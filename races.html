   What are racing servers? 
  </H2>
  
  <p>
   Race servers on the fivem server list provide players with (most of the time) multiple race tracks to race on with their favorite cars. You could try to break your own highscore, you could race others or you can just test out the handling and/or speed in different cars. Most of the servers also host a lot of events where you can win prices or just to get to that number one place on the scoreboard. Under this text balloon you will find a race on a fivem server.
